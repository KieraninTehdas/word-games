# About

This is the spiritual successor to my [first React app](https://github.com/KieraninTehdas/pairs) which was a very simple pairs game with poor styling and iffy Javascript. I have since learned more about both, though I'm still very green as will probably be evident!

As with the previous project, this little app is basically a yak shave rather than learning my Finnish vocabulary. Much better to build an app for it and learn tech skills first right!?
